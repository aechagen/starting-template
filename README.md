# "Starting Template"

.. It's basically just a bunch of base styles that I like, as well
as some cool CSS stuff I like right now. Started because all because
FreeCodeCamp RWD projects... Long story short, CodePen didn't let me
use pictures, which was weird. Decided to use GH-pages to do the projects
instead, started the first project for "Tribute Page", and then got distracted
setting up the initial index.html/main.css. Decided to gather my thoughts and 
pull together this beautiful repo. Now I guess I can do work on the actual projects!
Just fork and go! Onward!
